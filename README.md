# **Lung Cancer Patient Prediction**

This project aims to predict lung cancer patients using a supervised machine learning approach with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm.

## **Overview**

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of lung cancer patients are crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze clinical data and predict the likelihood of an individual being diagnosed with lung cancer.

## **Libraries**

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. scikit-learn (sklearn)

## **Workflow**

1. Data Setup and Libraries Import
Importing necessary datasets and essential libraries for data manipulation and modeling.

2. Data Cleaning
Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

3. Data Partitioning
Splitting the dataset into input features and output labels.

4. Train-Test Split
Dividing the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

5. Data Normalization
Normalizing the input features using MinMax scaler normalization.

6. Model Creation
Building the SVM classification model to predict lung cancer patients.

7. Performance Evaluation
Evaluating the model's performance using confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification reports (recall, precision, f1_score).

8. Graphical Representation
Visualizing the confusion matrix using Confusion Matrix Display for better insights.

## **Results**

The developed model achieves an accuracy score of 94%, indicating its effectiveness in predicting lung cancer patients. Detailed performance metrics such as recall, precision, and F1-score are also provided to assess the model's predictive capabilities.
